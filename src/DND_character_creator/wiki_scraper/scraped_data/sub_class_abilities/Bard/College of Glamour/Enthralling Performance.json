Choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet who watched and listened, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 hour, speaking glowingly of you and hindering anyone who opposes you. If a target succeeds on its saving throw, it has no hint that you tried to charm it. This feature can be used once per short or long rest.",
