  "description": "Starting at 3rd level, you harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your Psionic Energy dice, which are each a d6. You have a number of these dice equal to twice your proficiency bonus, and they fuel various psionic powers you have. You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish a long rest, and as a bonus action, you can regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. The size of your Psionic Energy dice increases at certain levels: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).",
