  "description": "Your draconic spirit reaches its peak. You gain the following benefits: Augment Breath - When you use your Breath of the Dragon, you can spend 1 ki point to augment its shape and power. The exhalation becomes either a 60-foot cone or a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice), and each creature in that area takes damage equal to four rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Blindsight - You gain blindsight out to 10 feet. Explosive Fury - When you activate your Aspect of the Wyrm, draconic fury explodes from you. Choose any number of creatures you can see in your aura. Each must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your ki save DC or take 3d10 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your choice).",
