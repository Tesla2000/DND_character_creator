You gain the following benefits: When you're prone, you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed. When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can spend 1 ki point as a reaction to cause that attack to hit one creature of your choice, other than the attacker, that you can see within 5 feet of you.",
