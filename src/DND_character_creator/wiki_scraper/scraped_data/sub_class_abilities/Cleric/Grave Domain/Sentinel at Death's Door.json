As a reaction when you or an ally within 30 feet suffers a critical hit, you can turn that attack into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.",
