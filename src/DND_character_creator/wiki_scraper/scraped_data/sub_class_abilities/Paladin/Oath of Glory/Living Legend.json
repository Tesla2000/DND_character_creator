As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute: You are blessed with an otherworldly presence, gaining advantage on all Charisma checks; Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead; If you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to reroll it. You must use this new roll. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.",
