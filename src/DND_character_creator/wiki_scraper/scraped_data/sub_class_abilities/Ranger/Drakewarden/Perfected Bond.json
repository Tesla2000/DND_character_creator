  "description": "At 15th level, your bond to your drake reaches the pinnacle of its power. While your drake is summoned, its Bite attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type chosen for its Draconic Essence (for a total of 2d6 extra damage). The drake grows to Large size and is no longer prohibited from using the flying speed. When either you or the drake takes damage while you\u2019re within 30 feet of each other, you can use your reaction to give yourself or the drake resistance to that instance of damage, up to your proficiency bonus times per long rest.",
