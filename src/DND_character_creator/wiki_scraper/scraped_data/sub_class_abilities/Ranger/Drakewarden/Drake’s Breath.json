  "description": "At 11th level, as an action, you can exhale a 30-foot cone of damaging breath or cause your drake to exhale it. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage. Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 8d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. This damage increases to 10d6 when you reach 15th level. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use it again.",
