When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter's stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest: Major Transformation (transmute one nonmagical object \u2013 no larger than a 5-foot cube \u2013 into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value); Panacea (remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature you touch with the transmuter's stone, and the creature regains all its hit points); Restore Life (cast the Raise Dead spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter's stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook); Restore Youth (reduce a willing creature's apparent age by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years).",
