  "description": "Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target equal to your proficiency bonus, any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20, and if the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.",
