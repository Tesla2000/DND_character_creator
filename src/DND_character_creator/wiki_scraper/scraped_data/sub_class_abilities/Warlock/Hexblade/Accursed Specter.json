  "description": "Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it in your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands and gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0). The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest. Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest.",
