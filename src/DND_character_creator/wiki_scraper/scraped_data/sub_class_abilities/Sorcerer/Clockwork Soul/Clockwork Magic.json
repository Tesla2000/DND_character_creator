Each spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn\u2019t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. These spells can\u2019t be replaced when you gain a level in this class. Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an abjuration or a transmutation spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.",
