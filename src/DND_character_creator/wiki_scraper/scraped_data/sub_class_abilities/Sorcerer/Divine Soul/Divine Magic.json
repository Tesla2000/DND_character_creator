You can choose a new spell from the cleric spell list or the sorcerer spell list when learning a sorcerer cantrip or spell of 1st level or higher. You must obey all restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you. You also learn an additional spell based on your chosen affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality.",
