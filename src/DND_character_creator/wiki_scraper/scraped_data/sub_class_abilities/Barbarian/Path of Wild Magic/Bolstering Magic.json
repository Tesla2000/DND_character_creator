  "description": "Beginning at 6th level, you can harness your wild magic to bolster yourself or a companion. As an action, you can touch one creature (which can be yourself) and confer one of the following benefits of your choice to that creature: For 10 minutes, the creature can roll a d3 whenever making an attack roll or an ability check and add the number rolled to the d20 roll. Roll a d3. The creature regains one expended spell slot, the level of which equals the number rolled or lower (the creature\u2019s choice). Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can\u2019t receive it again until after a long rest. You can take this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.",
