Effects depend on the environment chosen for your Storm Aura: Desert allows you to force a creature that hits you to make a Dexterity saving throw or take fire damage; Sea allows you to force a creature you hit to make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone; Tundra allows you to reduce a creature's speed to 0 until the start of your next turn.",
