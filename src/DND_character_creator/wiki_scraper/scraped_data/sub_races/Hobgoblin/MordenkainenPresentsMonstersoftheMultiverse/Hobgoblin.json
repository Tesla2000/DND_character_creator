You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Starting at 3rd level, choose one of the options below each time you take the Help action with this trait: Hospitality (you and the creature you help each gain temporary hit points), Passage (you and the creature you help each increase your walking speeds), Spite (the target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes).",
    "Fortune from the Many: If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or saving throw, you can draw on your bonds of reciprocity to gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you, maximum bonus of +3."
