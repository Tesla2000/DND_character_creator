    "Hold Breath: You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour.",
    "Natural Armor: Your shell provides you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn\u2019t affect this number). You can\u2019t wear light, medium, or heavy armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield\u2019s bonus as normal.",

    "Shell Defense: You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can\u2019t increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can\u2019t take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell."
